            <p>In the beginning of 2017, I was asked to renew the digital PDF newspaper app of De Volkskrant for smartphones and tablet. I teamed up with their Art Director and we set out to ideate, design and prototype this new reading experience during weekly design sprints. The goal was to design a product that had the renown but also abstract "paper-y" feeling; a thing many people love about newspapers. </p>
            <p>With this product, De Volkskrant hoped to reduce the churn while also creating new revenue streams.</p>

            <p class="job-description-subtitle">Key findings</p>
            <p>By testing our own prototypes, current news apps and copies of newspapers, we learned that the "paper-y" feeling didn't only come from touching the material. A couple of key findings from the target group:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>People value experiences that they can finish more than experiences that never end. News apps provide an endless stream of articles. Newspapers don't.</li>
              <li>When people flick through the newspapers, they feel exactly how far they are and how much pages are left. This gives them a high valued sense of control and progress. News apps with scrollbars don't, because the articles themselve are not taken in to consideration.</li>
              <li>Less is more when it comes to articles. People are more prepared to pay for a smaller set of articles than an endless stream. Even if the endless stream also containes the same smaller set.</li>
              <li>Each page in a newspaper is tailor made and unique. This makes it more valuable than the generic pages that everyone knows of news sites. Handmade triumps automation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              After a few of months of creating wireframes, designs, prototypes, user tests and strategy adjustments, the talented developers of <a href="https://q42.nl" title="Q42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q42</a> started building the app during weekly sprints. We continued to shave and improve the product until we launched a tablet app that had the "paper-y" feeling our target group wants and provided the editors with a way to express each page in their own unique way.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The weekly user retention increased from 2 to 4 times per week</li>
                <li>Increased average time spent from 15 to 22 minutes</li>
                <li>During the beta-period, the number of digital subscriptions sold tripled</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Time will tell if the product helped to reduce the churn. However, considering the customer loyalty, the average time spent and number of sold subscriptions went up, it's a result that I'm extremely proud of. Following these resutls, De Persgroep (owner of De Volkskrant) decided to whitelabel the product so other news brands could also profit from the concept. My main take-away from this project is that good enough is the enemy of perfection, but perfection is the enemy of progress. There is a time for perfection and a time for progress.</p>

            <p>Autotrack reached out to me when they wanted to rethink their mobile strategy. They were not happy with how the app contributed to their business results and figured a complete new user experience was needed. Before we started the design process, we decided more research was needed. We set up user interviews and tested the native apps to see what drives their users. We contacted potential car buyers to come in and use our app, while we gave them some tasks.</p>
            <p>During the user interviews and tests it became clear that the app still fits the most prominent user needs. We did notice usability errors and found out that some features were too hidden. We decided a complete redesign was not neccessary. The simple and elegant no-nonsense concept of the app was still a valid idea. Instead, we focussed on improving the existing screens by making features like compare cars and save search queries more prominent, improved the usability of the filters and add a feature to remove cars from the search result lists.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>While I would have loved to completely redesign the experience in the app, it became very clear during the user tests that it wasn't neccesary. As long as Autotrack doesn't want to pivot to a entire new strategy, a redesign would have been a waste of resources. This was a hard thing to present, but we get paid to do the hard things. I learned to seperate the things that we want to do and the things we really need to do.</p>

            <p>Carsom was a new initiative by Autotrack that aimed to make car maintenance more transparant by letting users compare quotes from nearby car mechanics. I got on board as a Product Owner and UX Designer to improve the user experience. It was a small team which allowed me to do a lot of different things. At Carsom I worked close with an external development team to reduce the legacy that kept Carsom from innovating. I redesigned flows to increase quote requests and designed a platform for dealers and car mechanics to automatically answer quote requests with detailed price and part information. We were able to do this by combining numerous data feeds.</p>

        <p>Ever since Carsom launched in 2012, the car industry was changing in a high pace. This made it hard to get the full commitment of partners to further develop Carsom and create more value for our users. We learned some hard lessons. With the loss of some strategic partners due to acquisitions, we didn't reach a critical mass in time to become selfsustainable. I left in 2014 to pursue a full User Experience Design career and the team eventually managed to <a href="https://automotive-management.nl/nieuws/laatste-nieuws/personen/15002-carsom-autotrack-gaat-samenwerken-met-bosch" title="Bosch Car Service koopt Carsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell Carsom to Bosch Car Service</a>.</p>

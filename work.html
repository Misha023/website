I'm responsible for designing user flows that allows each brand to sign up users and sell subscriptions in their own way. A business requirement is that it must be reusable. This makes sure the development team doesn't have to build tailor made flows for each brand. For this reason I started creating a Flow Component Library,  inspired by Design Systems. This is a framework of flows that each brand can use to meet their specific needs. It enables marketers to focus on running experiments without breaking a flow.

I worked close with user research to define user needs and categorized them in target groups. A key aspect of this research was to find the intrinsic motivation behind reading news. I conceptualized, designed and prototyped different solutions to cater to these needs during design sprints. After the define phase, I helped the product owner write user stories, supported development during their sprints and helped marketing with the product and pricing models.<br>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph"><a href="https://trouw.nl" title="Trouw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trouw</a> is a Dutch daily newspaper that struggled with their digital transformation. I researched the target group, designed the website and content management system. While every online newsbrand was screaming for attention and tried to publish as many articles as possible, Trouw wanted to be quality over quantity with more focus on their core values. At the same time, they were running on a skeleton staff due to economic circumstandings and previous failed online initiatives. One of the major wishes the editorial team had was to simplify the publishing process. They wanted to spend less time managing and more time writing. I designed a 'no-hands-on-deck'-process for the team and a website that reflected the core values. Since the target group was an older public (55+), we decided to design a product that was as legible as possible. This meant almost no heavy graphics and a strong focus on text.</p>

We designed the website, apps and CMS with workflows for the editorial teams. This minimized the publication time for the editors allowing them to write a lot more articles.

I got on board as a Product Owner and UX Designer to lead the development team to improve the user experience. I've conceptualized and designed two major features. One was an automated system where users could input their license plate number to get detailed insights in which parts needed change or maintenance. If a part needed change or maintenance, the user could see which nearby garages could help. The second was an automated system which answered incoming quote requests for car mechanics. With this system, car mechanics got a detailed description about the job and a rough estimate what the profit margin would be. This enabled them to spend less time answering quote requests and more time in the workplace. In the end, a car mechanic only had to look at the calculated profit margin and decide to accept or reject the job.</p>

In the second redesign project (<a href="https://tweakers.net/plan/738/tweakers-start-open-beta-voor-responsive-design.html" title="Tweakers start open beta voor responsive design" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2013</a>) I spearheaded Dutch mobile development by implementing a responsive design. I spend most of my time talking with the community to gather their wishes and <a href="https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1543033" title="Algemene info over het responsive design" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explaining our choices</a>. I worked with stakeholders to write business requirements and shape the mobile roadmap. There were some hard decisions to make. For example: I decided to sunset the native apps, so we could focus on the development of the responsive design. In the end, the community embraced the new design as it offered the full Tweakers experience on every device.</p>

                <p>Autotrack reached out to me when they wanted to rethink their mobile strategy. They were not happy with how the app contributed to their business results and figured a complete new user experience was needed. Before we started the design process, we decided more research was needed. We set up user interviews and tested the native apps to see what drives their users. We contacted potential car buyers to come in and use our app, while we gave them some tasks.</p>
                <p>During the user interviews and tests it became clear that the app still fits the most prominent user needs. We did notice usability errors and found out that some features were too hidden. We decided a complete redesign was not neccessary. The simple and elegant no-nonsense concept of the app was still a valid idea. Instead, we focussed on improving the existing screens by making features like compare cars and save search queries more prominent, improved the usability of the filters and add a feature to remove cars from the search result lists.</p>

            <p>While I would have loved to completely redesign the experience in the app, it became very clear during the user tests that it wasn't neccesary. As long as Autotrack doesn't want to pivot to a entire new strategy, a redesign would have been a waste of resources. This was a hard thing to present, but we get paid to do the hard things. I learned to seperate the things that we want to do and the things we really need to do.</p>

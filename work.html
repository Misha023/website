            <p class="timeline-paragraph">De Persgroep houses a lot of different brands with vastly different business models. A common denominator is that each brand has to convert users at some point. Whether it's to subscribe or register an email address to start a free trial. In the past each brand was reinventing the wheel and buildig their own conversion flows. More often then not, they ignored lessons learned by other brands. De Persgroep wanted to transition to platform-based products and asked me to design a solution.</p>
            <p class="timeline-paragraph">The core requirement was that it had to be reusable by all brands, but also allow for tailor made experiences. One big challenge was that there was a lot of technical debt and legacy systems. I conceptualized and designed a system for conversion flows to start  incremental improvements. At the same time, we develop our vision of the ideal dream flow for each brand. Each increment had to contribute to this vision.
            </p>
            <p class="timeline-paragraph">I managed to do this by aligning business units and map similar goals and requirements. I explored the technical landscape together with architects to define limits and possibilities. With the product owner of each squad, we defined the roadmap. We wrote epics and broke these down in user stories. I started a pattern library consisting of reusable flow components. Visual designers of each brand used this library to create a style guide for their own products. In collaboration with analysts and user researchers, we subjected them to a/b tests and user tests to validate our assumptions. My end goal was to create a system that consisted of validated patterns. This enabled designers and marketers of each brand to experiment with flows without harming the user experience or accessibility.

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">To help them express user flows, I also designed the User Flow Kit for Sketch. This Sketch Library helps them create robust user flows by offering connectors, flow and form elements. All within the comforts of Sketch. With permission from De Persgroep, I can share this library.

              <p class="timeline-paragraph">The Editie Mobile App Platform is the new way to publish digital newspapers on mobile devices. Users describe it as a "Harry Potter newspaper". I worked close with user research to define user needs and categorized them in target groups. A key aspect of this research was to find the intrinsic motivation behind reading news. I conceptualized, designed and prototyped different solutions to cater to these needs during design sprints. After the define phase, I helped the product owner write user stories, supported development during their sprints and helped marketing with the product and pricing models.</p>

            <p class="timeline-paragraph">Video remains a big question in the media industry. Is vertical video a thing? How do we produce high quality videos for a multitude of aspect ratios? How does video blend with contemporary online journalism? How can we attract a young audience to view our video content? To answer these and more questions, I conceptualized and prototyped solutions during rapid prototyping workshops. The goal was to discover which opportunities De Persgroep has and how to prepare for them. I conducted stakeholder interviews to research the market and find challenges and opportunities. I pitched several ideas, ranging from a social video watching experience and a mobile CMS specialized in rapid video capturing for multiple aspect ratios</p>

In six months, I defined the online strategy and redesigned the digital precense. I did this by running workshops with stakeholders to align business requirements. With market researchers, we defined a target audience and researched their needs. Based on the research, we made a responsive design for the website and made two hybrid apps. One of the challenges the editorial team faced was a decline in resources. We implemented a CMS that allowed a 'no-hands-on-deck'. This meant that the team could spent more time writing content and less time managing the website. To increase revenue, we reimagined the subscription and advertisement propositions to better reflect modern business practices.</p>

I got on board as a Product Owner and UX Designer to lead the development team to improve the user experience. I've conceptualized and designed two major features. One was an automated system where users could input their license plate number to get detailed insights in which parts needed change or maintenance. If a part needed change or maintenance, the user could see which nearby garages could help. The second was an automated system which answered incoming quote requests for car mechanics. With this system, car mechanics got a detailed description about the job and a rough estimate what the profit margin would be. This enabled them to spend less time answering quote requests and more time in the workplace. In the end, a car mechanic only had to look at the calculated profit margin and decide to accept or reject the job.</p>

I worked with stakeholders to write business requirements and shape the mobile roadmap. There were some hard decisions to make. For example: I decided to sunset the native apps, so we could focus on the development of the responsive design.

                <p>Autotrack reached out to me when they wanted to rethink their mobile strategy. They were not happy with how the app contributed to their business results and figured a complete new user experience was needed. Before we started the design process, we decided more research was needed. We set up user interviews and tested the native apps to see what drives their users. We contacted potential car buyers to come in and use our app, while we gave them some tasks.</p>
                <p>During the user interviews and tests it became clear that the app still fits the most prominent user needs. We did notice usability errors and found out that some features were too hidden. We decided a complete redesign was not neccessary. The simple and elegant no-nonsense concept of the app was still a valid idea. Instead, we focussed on improving the existing screens by making features like compare cars and save search queries more prominent, improved the usability of the filters and add a feature to remove cars from the search result lists.</p>

            <p>While I would have loved to completely redesign the experience in the app, it became very clear during the user tests that it wasn't neccesary. As long as Autotrack doesn't want to pivot to a entire new strategy, a redesign would have been a waste of resources. This was a hard thing to present, but we get paid to do the hard things. I learned to seperate the things that we want to do and the things we really need to do.</p>
